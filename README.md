# MyEvent

This is a java web application for managing events.

## Running

Run this using [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).  If you downloaded this project from https://github.com/ismailfakir/MyEvent then you'll find a prepackaged version of sbt in the project directory:

```
sbt run
```

And then go to http://localhost:9000 to see the running web application.
